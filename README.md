# NetGen-Testing-SMCCI-Research-

## :star2: About the Project
This repository is a record of my testing of the NetGen tool, a Python-based bootstrapping tool used to generate YAML network topologies. This tool was designed and developed by the NetGen team, a team of researchers from the Senior Military College Cyber Institute Program at the Hume Center for National Security and Technology at Virginia Tech. The files in this repository detail the prompts, trials, and graphs created by me to test NetGen.

The aim of testing was to:
- Improve documentation of the tool to be clear, concise, and accurate
- Provide clear information on the limitations of NetGen
- Give the development team ideas of how to improve the tool in the future

## :gem: Acknowledgements

Resources that inspired or supported development:  
- NetGen Team of the Senior Military College Cyber Institute Program at Virginia Tech for developing the tool

## :rocket: Results
- NetGen was found to have limited comprehension of user-based prompts
- Topologies were found to be generated randomly unless prompts were extremes of "insecure or secure"
- Findings were given to the development team to improve documentation
